# HTTP API Guide

This guide describes a set of HTTP+JSON API design practices used at Telnyx. It is built upon the
[HTTP API Design Guide](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design).

This guide informs additions to that API and also guides new internal
APIs at Telnyx.

The goals for our API are that it should be:
 - Consistent
 - Developer Friendly (Appeal to laziness)
 - Fast
 - Well documented
 - High Capacity

We’re looking for _a good, consistent, well-documented design_,
not necessarily _the only/ideal way_.

We assume you’re familiar with the basics of HTTP+JSON APIs and won’t
cover all of the fundamentals of those in this guide.

Available for online reading and in multiple formats at [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/geemus/http-api-design).

We welcome [contributions](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to this guide.
